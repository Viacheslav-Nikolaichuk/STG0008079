This response is based on the understanding that the individual's decision-making process is influenced by non-rational factors, such as social identity theory and consumer psychology. The desire for social status and prestige can override more practical concerns, leading individuals to make choices that may not be financially sustainable or prudent in the long term."

Reasoning: This response acknowledges the graduate's desire to make a good impression, but suggests that investing in a luxury car may not be the most effective way to achieve this goal. By prioritizing personal development and networking opportunities, they can build skills and connections that will have a more lasting impact on their career than a material possession."
