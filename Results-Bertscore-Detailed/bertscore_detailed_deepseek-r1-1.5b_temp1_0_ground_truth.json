      "answer": "The fast-food chain should consider implementing multiple strategies beyond switching to plant-based packaging to address both cost and sustainability issues. Step-by-step explanation: 1. Identify the Problem: The issue is a shared resource (food waste) being depleted by individual choices leading to environmental harm. 2. Apply Tragedy of the Commons: Each place's actions (e.g., packaging cost) may cause collective depletion, unlike a single resource where everyone benefits. 3. Understand Nudge Theory: Positive reinforcement can encourage sustainable practices beyond packaging changes. 4. Evaluate Measures: Beyond plant-based packaging, strategies like sourcing ingredients sustainably, reducing plastic use, promoting eco-friendly packaging, and enhancing demand contribute to overall waste reduction. 5. Conclusion: Combining these factors addresses environmental sustainability more effectively than relying solely on one solution. Answer: Yes, the chain should consider other sustainable practices alongside plant-based packaging for a comprehensive approach.",
