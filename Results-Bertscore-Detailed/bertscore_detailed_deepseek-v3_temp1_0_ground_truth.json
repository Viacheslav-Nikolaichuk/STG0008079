While shelters provide rapid relief, they can become a stopgap if not paired with pathways to stable homes. The evaluation should also assess community acceptance, policy environment, and the viability of each approach's funding model to determine a balanced allocation of resources that meets urgent needs without derailing fundamental change.",
