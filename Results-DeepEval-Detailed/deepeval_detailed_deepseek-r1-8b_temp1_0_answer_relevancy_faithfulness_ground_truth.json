      "question": "What steps could be taken to implement a more measured security strategy that addresses vulnerabilities without causing severe disruptions to the company's ongoing projects?",
      "reference": "A measured approach would begin with phased rollouts: upgrade the most critical and high-risk systems first while gradually incorporating less essential areas. Form specialized cross-functional teams to design and execute the security overhaul, ensuring minimal overlap with mission-critical project timelines. Conduct rigorous pilot tests of new security protocols in controlled environments, fine-tuning them before widespread deployment. Establish clear communication channels that keep leadership, IT, and other relevant departments aligned on timelines, budgets, and risk thresholds. Lastly, maintain robust training programs and user-friendly documentation so staff can adapt efficiently, reducing operational bottlenecks and maximizing the effectiveness of the new security measures.",
