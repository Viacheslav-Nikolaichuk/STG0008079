      "reference": "Rare disease research often relies on cutting-edge science and innovative methodologies because traditional commercial incentives are lower. Many past breakthroughs in orphan drug development emerged from smaller, riskier initiatives that eventually gained regulatory traction. However, success rates can be low, and rigorous backing\u2014both financial and institutional\u2014is typically needed. In addition, when a breakthrough does occur, it can transform medical protocols and open pathways for future research. Thus, while the probability of revolutionizing treatment isn't guaranteed, there is precedent suggesting that under-supported, high-potential efforts can yield dramatic advances, especially with a committed infrastructure behind them.",
      "answer": "The broader landscape shows that while most high-risk rare disease projects face significant obstacles and a low success rate, occasional breakthroughs from unconventional research suggest that if validated, this experimental project could indeed revolutionize treatment options despite the inherent uncertainties."

      "reference": "One strategy is adopting a hybrid approach: allocate a portion of the grant to emergency shelters while funneling remaining resources into permanent supportive housing and advocacy. Set up robust referral systems from shelters to long-term housing opportunities, and partner with local governments and community developers to reduce barriers. Maintain transparency with the donor about the nonprofit's multi-pronged vision, ensuring they see how short-term interventions tie into sustainable outcomes. Finally, conduct regular impact assessments to confirm that funds aren't diverted wholly into stopgap measures and to validate that permanent solutions progress in parallel.",
      "answer": "Adopt a dual-pronged strategy that allocates part of the grant to rapid-response temporary shelters with clear exit plans while dedicating the remaining resources to permanent housing initiatives and policy advocacy, ensuring constant evaluation and stakeholder engagement to maintain systemic reform objectives."
