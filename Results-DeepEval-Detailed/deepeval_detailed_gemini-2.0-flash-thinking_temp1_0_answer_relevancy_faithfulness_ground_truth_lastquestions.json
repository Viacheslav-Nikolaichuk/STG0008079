      "reference": "Rare disease research often relies on cutting-edge science and innovative methodologies because traditional commercial incentives are lower. Many past breakthroughs in orphan drug development emerged from smaller, riskier initiatives that eventually gained regulatory traction. However, success rates can be low, and rigorous backing\u2014both financial and institutional\u2014is typically needed. In addition, when a breakthrough does occur, it can transform medical protocols and open pathways for future research.

      "question": "How might future technological advancements (e.g., cleaner cars, improved public transit systems) alter the long-term impact and necessity of a congestion charge?",
      "reference": "As electric and low-emission vehicles become more affordable, or as public transit systems become faster and more efficient, the rationale for a congestion charge could evolve. In a best-case scenario, cleaner cars reduce pollution, meaning the charge might shift focus to purely congestion management rather than emissions control. Advanced mobility solutions\u2014like smart ride-sharing or autonomous electric buses\u2014could further reduce traffic volume. However, if these technologies remain out of reach for lower-income groups, the charge might still be needed to regulate road use equitably. The city's policy should remain adaptable to these shifting technological and economic realities.",
      "answer": "Cleaner vehicles and improved transit could lessen the environmental imperative of congestion charges, shifting their necessity towards managing urban traffic flow and funding sustainable transportation alternatives."
