Finally, consulting legal advisors and insurance specialists ensures clarity on liabilities and coverage, minimizing financial fallout should an incident occur. The challenge is to implement these safeguards in a way that doesn't unduly slow down operations or inflate costs beyond the benefits of the route.",
