However, there is a risk that broadening the user base could compromise the unique features that made the product appealing to its loyal niche audience. Additionally, scaling too fast may strain the company's limited resources and affect product quality, potentially eroding brand trust. Balancing investor demands for rapid growth with sustainable market positioning is a critical challenge.",
