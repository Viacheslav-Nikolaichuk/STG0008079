    "answer": "After observing high payouts at a roulette table, it's unlikely to attribute such results to an unusual event like a lucky streak. The outcomes follow typical probability distributions without indication of change, similar to other players. Answer: After seeing big wins, there's no evidence to suggest a lucky streak; results are consistent with the game's inherent rules and normal variance. Adjusting strategy wouldn't be needed. Answer in one sentence: Seeing high payouts doesn't indicate a lucky streak. Results follow expected probability distributions without change. Answer: No, results likely reflect typical outcomes from roulette mechanics.",
    "reference": "No. Each roulette spin is independent, and the house edge remains the same regardless of past outcomes. Observing multiple big wins does not increase your odds on subsequent spins.",

The decision should factor in how damaging a breach would be in terms of customer confidence and long-term brand value, weighing those intangible costs against the upfront resource investments.

While short-term financial considerations matter for the company's bottom line, ethical responsibility dictates actively protecting sensitive data, maintaining trust, and safeguarding customer privacy. Failing to address known vulnerabilities could be seen as neglecting a fundamental duty of care. Ultimately, the ethics hinge on the risk tolerance the firm is willing to impose on its customers, employees, and partners, especially if postponing leaves them vulnerable to significant harm.",
