While it discourages excessive sugar consumption, small businesses, especially those in the sugar manufacturing sector, are likely to suffer significantly as they face reduced sales. Additionally, this measure could lead to widespread job losses within the local economy and may negatively impact the purchasing habits of many consumers who already have alternatives for sweetened beverages.",

The measure can still be effective, though not universally, in lowering overall sugar intake.",
