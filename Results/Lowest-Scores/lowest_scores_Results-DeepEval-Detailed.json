This includes quantifying the potential savings against possible supply chain disruptions, hidden costs (such as local compliance requirements), and reputational risks. While the allure of immediate cost reduction is strong, an equally thorough assessment of potential long-term liabilities, including political changes and cultural integration challenges, is crucial.

Although it demands significant upfront costs and workforce training, it supports domestic employment (albeit evolving in nature) and minimizes the geopolitical risks tied to international operations. At the same time, choosing local automation fosters a resilient supply chain that is less vulnerable to external political shifts. However, there is no absolute right answer\u2014overseas expansion might still be a valid path if thorough risk mitigation strategies are adopted and labor standards are responsibly upheld.
