    "answer": "Prioritizing fleeting gains by leveraging anxieties about missing out risks damaging the established positive brand perception and eroding the very foundation of authentic customer relationships.",
    "reference": "The ethics of a FOMO-centered campaign depend on whether it manipulates consumer psychology in a way that contradicts the brand's values. Exploiting scarcity or social pressure can be seen as manipulative if it doesn't align with the brand's professed authenticity and transparency. To maintain ethical credibility, the campaign must still respect consumer autonomy and present factual information, rather than simply triggering anxiety or impulsive behavior. Brands committed to genuine sustainability messaging typically aim for honest persuasion, so any marketing tactic that conflicts with that ethos risks undermining trust.",
