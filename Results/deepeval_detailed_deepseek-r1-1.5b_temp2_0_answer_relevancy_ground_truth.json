They should also balance immediate expenses with long-term financial goals, possibly exploring alternatives like renting or leasing if necessary."

      "answer": "Yes, your decision is influenced by two factors: affordability (as per Affordability Heuristic) and social signaling (as per Social Signaling). The $70k luxury car might be affordably priced for you given your income, but it's not the most cost-effective option overall. Its appeal could also signal its reliability to others through good appearances, potentially enhancing your career opportunities through professional pride."
