      "reference": "A robust evaluation considers both quantitative data (e.g., projected drop in congestion and carbon output) and qualitative concerns (e.g., how restricted mobility might affect marginalized communities). It's crucial to analyze whether alternative transport modes or subsidies exist to mitigate undue burdens on those less able to pay. In addition, exploring the effect on small businesses involves reviewing consumer behavior data, local foot traffic patterns, and potential shifts toward online shopping. Ultimately, a multi-factor assessment ensures that the congestion charge's environmental benefits do not come at an unfair social or economic cost.",

In a best-case scenario, cleaner cars reduce pollution, meaning the charge might shift focus to purely congestion management rather than emissions control. Advanced mobility solutions\u2014like smart ride-sharing or autonomous electric buses\u2014could further reduce traffic volume. However, if these technologies remain out of reach for lower-income groups, the charge might still be needed to regulate road use equitably. The city's policy should remain adaptable to these shifting technological and economic realities.",
      "answer": "Technological advancements like cleaner cars and enhanced public transit could diminish the long-term necessity of congestion charges by naturally addressing their underlying goals of emissions reduction and traffic management."
