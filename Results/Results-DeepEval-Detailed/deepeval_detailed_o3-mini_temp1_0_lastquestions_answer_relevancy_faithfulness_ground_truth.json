      "reference": "As electric and low-emission vehicles become more affordable, or as public transit systems become faster and more efficient, the rationale for a congestion charge could evolve. In a best-case scenario, cleaner cars reduce pollution, meaning the charge might shift focus to purely congestion management rather than emissions control. Advanced mobility solutions\u2014like smart ride-sharing or autonomous electric buses\u2014could further reduce traffic volume. However, if these technologies remain out of reach for lower-income groups, the charge might still be needed to regulate road use equitably. The city's policy should remain adaptable to these shifting technological and economic realities.",
      "answer": "Advancements in cleaner transportation options could spread the burden of mitigating urban congestion and environmental degradation across multiple stakeholders and pathways-thereby lessening the concentrated pressures on low-income residents and the overuse of shared infrastructure-that might otherwise necessitate a single, focused congestion charge."
