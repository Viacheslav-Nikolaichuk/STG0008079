      "question": "How should you balance the immediate costs of a full-scale security overhaul against the potential long-term repercussions of a serious data breach?",
      "reference": "A robust evaluation involves estimating both the financial impact of short-term system overhauls and the potential fallout from a significant data breach, which could lead to legal liabilities, regulatory penalties, and massive reputational harm. While quick fixes might preserve quarterly revenue goals, a full-scale upgrade offers stronger protection against worst-case scenarios. The decision should factor in how damaging a breach would be in terms of customer confidence and long-term brand value, weighing those intangible costs against the upfront resource investments. Ultimately, a thorough risk-benefit analysis that accounts for the probability of a breach, potential magnitude of losses, and public perception is essential before deciding on any path.",
      "answer": "Prioritize a comprehensive security overhaul immediately, recognizing that the long-term costs of a potential data breach, including reputational damage and loss of customer trust, far outweigh the short-term financial impact of proactive security measures."

      "question": "Is it ethically defensible to prioritize donor requirements for quick housing solutions if they overshadow the organization's broader mission for systemic reform?",
      "reference": "Whether it's ethically defensible depends on transparency with donors and stakeholders, as well as the actual outcomes for those served. Meeting urgent needs aligns with moral duties, but deviating too far from systemic goals risks perpetuating the cycle of homelessness. An ethical approach would seek a balance: accept donor funds for immediate relief while transparently maintaining a commitment to deeper advocacy and structural changes. If short-term fixes alone dominate the nonprofit's direction to the detriment of long-term solutions, this could be seen as compromising the core mission in favor of external demands.",
      "answer": "No, prioritizing donor requirements for quick housing solutions is ethically defensible only if strategically aligned with the organization's overarching mission for systemic reform."

      "question": "How might future technological advancements (e.g., cleaner cars, improved public transit systems) alter the long-term impact and necessity of a congestion charge?",
      "reference": "As electric and low-emission vehicles become more affordable, or as public transit systems become faster and more efficient, the rationale for a congestion charge could evolve. In a best-case scenario, cleaner cars reduce pollution, meaning the charge might shift focus to purely congestion management rather than emissions control. Advanced mobility solutions\u2014like smart ride-sharing or autonomous electric buses\u2014could further reduce traffic volume. However, if these technologies remain out of reach for lower-income groups, the charge might still be needed to regulate road use equitably. The city's policy should remain adaptable to these shifting technological and economic realities.",
