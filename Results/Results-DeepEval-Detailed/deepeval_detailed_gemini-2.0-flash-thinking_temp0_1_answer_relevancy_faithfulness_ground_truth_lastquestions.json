      "reference": "A robust evaluation considers both quantitative data (e.g., projected drop in congestion and carbon output) and qualitative concerns (e.g., how restricted mobility might affect marginalized communities). It's crucial to analyze whether alternative transport modes or subsidies exist to mitigate undue burdens on those less able to pay. In addition, exploring the effect on small businesses involves reviewing consumer behavior data, local foot traffic patterns, and potential shifts toward online shopping. Ultimately, a multi-factor assessment ensures that the congestion charge's environmental benefits do not come at an unfair social or economic cost.",
