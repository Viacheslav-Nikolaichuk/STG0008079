      "reference": "A structured rollout plan should include comprehensive staff education sessions, hands-on training, and channels for continuous feedback. Actively involve frontline employees in early testing and adjustments, so they feel ownership rather than burden. Set realistic timelines and provide adequate technical support (including 24/7 IT teams at launch) to minimize frustration. Periodic town halls or staff forums can help management address concerns in real time and refine processes on the fly. Finally, reward adaptability and encourage a culture of learning by recognizing employees who proactively master new skills, ensuring a collective effort rather than imposing top-down directives.",
      "answer": "Implement comprehensive training programs and establish open communication channels to address staff concerns, highlight AI's benefits, and foster a collaborative environment where their expertise complements the new system."

Factoring in capacity limits, ongoing operating costs, and the ultimate goal of genuinely ending homelessness is key. While shelters provide rapid relief, they can become a stopgap if not paired with pathways to stable homes. The evaluation should also assess community acceptance, policy environment, and the viability of each approach's funding model to determine a balanced allocation of resources that meets urgent needs without derailing fundamental change.",
