      "question": "What does the broader landscape of rare disease research tell us about the likelihood that this high-risk project could revolutionize treatment options in the future?",
      "reference": "Rare disease research often relies on cutting-edge science and innovative methodologies because traditional commercial incentives are lower. Many past breakthroughs in orphan drug development emerged from smaller, riskier initiatives that eventually gained regulatory traction. However, success rates can be low, and rigorous backing\u2014both financial and institutional\u2014is typically needed. In addition, when a breakthrough does occur, it can transform medical protocols and open pathways for future research. Thus, while the probability of revolutionizing treatment isn't guaranteed, there is precedent suggesting that under-supported, high-potential efforts can yield dramatic advances, especially with a committed infrastructure behind them.",
      "answer": "The history of rare disease breakthroughs-often born from high-risk, unconventional research-suggests that while success is uncertain, the potential for transformative impact justifies the gamble when balanced against the profound unmet need."
