      "answer": "The graduate's decision is likely driven by the psychological factor of social identity theory and the desire for conspicuous consumption, where owning a luxury car serves as a status symbol to validate their self-worth and perceived value in their professional and social circles. This response is based on research suggesting that people tend to associate material possessions with personal worth and status (Belk, 1988), which can motivate them to acquire luxury goods even if it strains their finances. Social identity theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1979) also suggests that individuals derive a sense of belonging and self-worth from their social group affiliations, which in this case may be perceived as being associated with the exclusive brand or model of car."

      "answer": "They should reconsider purchasing the luxury car and instead allocate their income towards building a solid financial foundation, as the long-term benefits of increased savings, investment, and financial security will likely outweigh any short-term gains from appearances made possible by owning such a vehicle. Reasoning: This response suggests that the recent graduate's priorities should be focused on establishing a stable financial base rather than making an extravagant purchase that may not ultimately yield the desired career benefits. A strong foundation in savings, investments, and debt management will provide greater flexibility and opportunities for growth, whereas a luxury car is a depreciating asset that may only temporarily enhance their appearance without providing lasting career value."
