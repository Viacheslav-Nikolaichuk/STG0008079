      "answer": "Purchasing a $70,000 luxury car on an income of $45,000/year would likely be financially unsound, as the monthly payments would consume nearly 50% of her net income, leaving little room for savings or unexpected expenses while also diverting resources from more effective long-term investment in career development."
