When major policy changes or leadership shifts occur, they can either bolster or hinder permanent solutions, impacting zoning laws, subsidies, and social service budgets. Temporary housing might see a surge in support if visible homelessness spikes, but long-term strategies often demand sustained advocacy to protect budgets and legislative backing. Understanding these shifts is critical: organizations that remain agile and proactively engage in policy dialogue are better positioned to secure stable support and adapt their housing programs over time.",
