      "reference": "Public opinion can oscillate between compassion fatigue and calls for rapid fixes, influencing political will and funding streams. When major policy changes or leadership shifts occur, they can either bolster or hinder permanent solutions, impacting zoning laws, subsidies, and social service budgets. Temporary housing might see a surge in support if visible homelessness spikes, but long-term strategies often demand sustained advocacy to protect budgets and legislative backing. Understanding these shifts is critical: organizations that remain agile and proactively engage in policy dialogue are better positioned to secure stable support and adapt their housing programs over time.",
