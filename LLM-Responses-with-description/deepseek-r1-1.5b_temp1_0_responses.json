Answer: The company is likely avoiding change because it's more comfortable with their current structure, preferring the familiarity and stability of their existing setup over moving to automation. So the answer sentence incorporates the core principle that familiar systems are preferred despite potential changes. The company avoids transition costs by maintaining a stable, familiar system while concerns grow about worker displacement."

Step-by-step explanation: 1. Identify the Problem: The issue is a shared resource (food waste) being depleted by individual choices leading to environmental harm. 2. Apply Tragedy of the Commons: Each place's actions (e.g., packaging cost) may cause collective depletion, unlike a single resource where everyone benefits. 3. Understand Nudge Theory: Positive reinforcement can encourage sustainable practices beyond packaging changes. 4. Evaluate Measures: Beyond plant-based packaging, strategies like sourcing ingredients sustainably, reducing plastic use, promoting eco-friendly packaging, and enhancing demand contribute to overall waste reduction. 5. Conclusion: Combining these factors addresses environmental sustainability more effectively than relying solely on one solution. Answer: Yes, the chain should consider other sustainable practices alongside plant-based packaging for a comprehensive approach."
