Reasoning: The calculation of debt-to-income ratio indicates that taking on such a large car payment would put the graduate at risk of accumulating high-interest debt and potentially damaging their credit score. Furthermore, luxury cars tend to depreciate rapidly, reducing their value over time, making this purchase more financially imprudent than practical for someone with limited income."
