However, if done strategically\u2014retaining core strengths while adopting new features that genuinely appeal to wider groups\u2014you can remain agile and outmaneuver slower incumbents. Being prepared to iterate rapidly and pivot again if the market climate changes is essential to sustaining growth in this fast-evolving environment.",
